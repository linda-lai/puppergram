## Background
A Ruby on Rails application created using Devise, Carrierwave and Bootstrap at a Rails Girls workshop in November 2018, and an excellent practical application for my growing horde of pupper pictures.

This was a fun opportunity to further reinforce my Rails learning, practice Git and experiment with new gems like Carrierwave, Bootstrap and Rspec.
